# Chatter

Chatter is a working Instagram clone that is ready to be deployed with basic features out of the box.

Users can create posts, like, and comment, all while being able to peruse other infinitely-generated user posts. (Note a post you make might not show up at the top of your feed, but below some other posts).

This was created as sample code for students in my CS395 class to build off and implement features such as authentication, SQLite3 integration, and more.

To get started simply clone,  the repo and type

    pip install Django
    python manage.py runserver

Chatter is built using:
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- SQLite3
- Python
- Django
- gunicorn (optionally, in deployment)
- nginx (optionally, in deployment)
- EC2 (optionally, in deployment)
